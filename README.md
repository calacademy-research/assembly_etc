# assembly_etc

Repo for assembly pipeline organization and scripts to support several sub-pipelines.
This is based on having PacBio HiFi reads and short HiC reads.

The entire contents of the scripts folder is intended to be accessible from a PATH directory setting.

Subset of these are shown in subfolders of the categories folder but just downloading one of those contents
will not necessari;y have all needed scripts.

The current assembler supported is hifiasm
